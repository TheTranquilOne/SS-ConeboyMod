# SS EN: A Cool Coneboy Mod
Assets used for Coneboy are either from the old leaked "P Rank Build" or are completely original!

That's all. Collect my Coneboys.

# Sugary Spire: Exhibition Night (The Reproduction)
This repository uses a work-in-progress decompilation of the "Sugary Spire: Exhibition Night" demo. It is close to 100% accurate to the original demo.

# Compilation
## Needed Materials
- GameMaker Studio version 2023.11 (any revision acceptable), runtime 2023.11.1.60
- [FMOD Engine](https://www.fmod.com/download#fmodengine) version 2.02.26 (You may need to make an FMOD account to download.)

From there, just load the project as you would any other, and press F5 to build!
